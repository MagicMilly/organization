# Resources for getting started with Agricultural Data Science

#### TODO 

- [ ] Add beginner links / tutorials for getting started with R, Python, and Julia
- [ ] Find **free** conferences or other events that have gone virtual (or offer scholarships)
- [ ] Beginner-friendly hackathons
- [ ] ODDPIG [OSF page](https://osf.io/3azht/wiki/home/)
- [ ] Add `HackMD` badge to this document
---

## Getting Started & Involved

### A. Join Communities
- Get to know others who can help you connect with agricultural data scientists or other scientific communities
- Find open Slack channels like [TERRA-REF](https://terraref-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/) and [Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/)
- Participate in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/) competitions and their message boards
    - Experienced data scientists share their code for cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, etc. for new data scientists to work through and learn from
    - Example of past competition: [Naive Bees Classifier](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/8/naive-bees-classifier/)
    - Kaggle also hosts open datasets, which sometimes include associated tasks
        - [agricultural](https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=agriculture) data
        - Example of task: creating an [image recognition model](https://towardsdatascience.com/module-6-image-recognition-for-insurance-claim-handling-part-i-a338d16c9de0) using labeled agricultural images
- Interact with other scientists on social media, especially Twitter and Instagram
    - [Black Women in Science](https://twitter.com/bwisnetwork?lang=en)
    - The `R` Twitter community in particular is very active and welcoming
        - #RLadies
        - #RStats
    - #OpenData
    - #OpenScience
    - #BLACKandSTEM
    - #AgChat
    - #AgTech
- North American Plant Phenotyping Network - [NAAPN](http://nappn.plant-phenotyping.org/)
    - Open Drones in Ag

### B. Contributing to Open Source Projects

- Use GitHub [Explore](https://github.com/explore) to find interesting ag projects
- Look for `good first issue` tags in programming languages you know or want to learn

### C. Contribute to and analyze data from Citizen Science projects

Contributing to existing open data projects is a great way to build skills, join communities, and share your data analyses and visualizations.

- [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) is one of the most popular citizen science projects, which researchers also use for data collection. All observation data is open for anybody with an account to download.
- Search for more Citizen Science and Crowdsourcing Projects on https://www.citizenscience.gov/

### D. Familiarize yourself and work with Open Data
- US Dept of Agriculture (USDA) Open Data [Catalog](https://www.usda.gov/content/usda-open-data-catalog)
- US Government Open [Data](https://www.data.gov/)
- [TERRA-REF](https://terraref.org/) Sorghum [Data](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4b8gtht99)
- [freecodecamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) list of the [Best Free Open Data Sources](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/https-medium-freecodecamp-org-best-free-open-data-sources-anyone-can-use-a65b514b0f2d/)
    - example: [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/gho/database/en/)

### E. Read academic papers and explore open science projects

- Find papers on topics you're interested in and search further research from those authors
    - https://scholar.google.com/
    - https://www.researchgate.net/
- Register for a free Open Science Framework [(OSF)](https://osf.io/register) account to explore public projects, where researchers share their data, code, analyses, and links to publications

### F. Other Resources

- Interest groups that include the use of drones in agriculture and geospatial information, among other, broader topics:
    - Earth System Information Partners [(ESIP)](https://www.esipfed.org/)
        - [Drone Cluster](https://osf.io/nuvem/)
        - [Agriculture and Climate](http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Agriculture_and_Climate)
    - Open Geospatial Consortium [(OGC)](https://www.osgeo.org/partners/ogc/)
        - [Unmanned Systems Domain Working Group](https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/uxsdwg)
        - [Agriculture Domain Working Group](https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/agriculturedwg)
