### Preparation

Before Tuesday please do the following. Together, I estimate this should take a total of 1.5-3 hours spread throughout the day: 

* review [last quarter's notes](https://hackmd.io/VDfLu1r5TreTlSxIeP2C5A)
* think back on what you accomplished in the last year and visualize where you will be and where the group will be at the end of 2020. What will be your key accomplishments in 2020? Also consider: was anything holding you back? What could have gone better?
* review and update 2019 Q4 OKR's, draft 2020 Q1 OKRs and identify three key accomplishments for 2020
* meet with David on Monday Afternoon to review Q1 OKRs and 2020 plans.
